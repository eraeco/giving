A platform to care for others.

## Why Philanthropy and Caring is important

Life has its up and downs for everyone.
In the past, you could rely on your family,
village/tribe or neighbors to help you through
Financial or Psychological down times.

As the world moves more digital, we lose this
support network. A social poke or like, just doesn't
cut for caring. And that is a loss for both those
who need help and those who want to help.

Donating money to someone in need can make a tangible
difference in their life. And giving something of our own
can make a digital effort more real to us.
Bringing some of that real life caring into the digital
experience.

Although money is at the heart of this experience it is a
means to an end. The end is helping someone who is struggling
to be self-reliant, through a patch of difficulty outside
of their control, so they can continue on their path to
self-reliance.

If you've ever been in that pinch, you know how it feels.
'If only I could pay this one bill and make it another month'

Let's help and pay forward the blessings we got in our life.

## Why you should contribute to this Repo

Further a good cause with time and skill instead of money.
You want to practice web design, use the GUN database in production
or just see a speling mistake you want to fix.
Here is a good place to learn and further a good cause at the same time.

The goal is to keep it simple, with as little an entry barrier as
possible to allow for contributions from all skill levels.

So don't be afraid to submit a PR or talk to us in the discord,
knowing that the aim is to help as many people as possible.

To start with, we will explore:
1. One vote per person for 1 person.
2. One person upvoting many.
3. One list of ranked/sorted votes per person.
4. Time/effort based voting.
5. Weighted voting. Like preferential stock, etc. some have more shares/power than others.
6. Debt based voting. (Costs money, or food fasting, etc.)
7. Threshold voting. (Rent needs X votes, while surgery needs Y)
8.  When a person gets X minimum or % of votes (using a method above).
